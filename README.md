# 🌿 Plantea — Pakistan's Smart Plant Marketplace

> A 3-sided mobile marketplace connecting plant **Buyers**, **Sellers**, and **Delivery Riders** across Pakistan — powered by AI plant identification and a zero-cost MVP stack.

---

# 📋 Project Overview

**Plantea** is a mobile application built for the Pakistani plant market. It allows:

- 🛒 **Buyers** to browse, search, and order plants by city
- 🌱 **Sellers** to list plants, get AI health scans, and manage orders
- 🚴 **Riders** to accept and deliver plant orders

The platform earns revenue through a **5–10% commission** on every order. Sellers can subscribe to a paid plan (Rs. 999/month) to reduce their commission rate from 10% to 5%.
